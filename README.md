FOODISM
- Android & IOS app where we post about anything food, do some operations on it,
  and look at what others have posted. 
- Built using flutter.
  - Used Scoped model. Just another way of wiring up buisness logic with UI.

IN DEVELOPMENT

- TODO
    -  //TODO Would have to change the logic of handling edit/create form using selectedProdId
        We are currently doing it by setting the id as null and checking it in most of the places. 

    - Using a third party package for maps. Might have to think of using the package flutter offers.
